============
Installation
============

This package requires NumPy, which you can install alone or as a part of SciPy.
`Some Python distributions <https://scipy.org/install/#distributions>`_ come
with NumPy/SciPy pre-installed. For Python distributions without NumPy/SciPy,
the operating system package managers can be used to install :py:mod:`numpy`.
However, this step may be unnecessary, as PyPi should install :py:mod:`numpy`
along with :py:mod:`aacgmv2` if it is missing.

We recommend installing this package at the command line using ``pip``::

    pip install aacgmv2

The package has been tested with the following setups (others might work, too):

* Mac (64 bit), Windows (64 bit), and Linux (64 bit)
* Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10
