Installation
============

This package requires NumPy, which you can install alone or as a part of SciPy.
`Some Python distributions <https://www.scipy.org/install.html#distributions>`_ come with NumPy/SciPy pre-installed. For Python distributions
without NumPy/SciPy, Windows/Mac users should install
`pre-compiled binaries of NumPy/SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html#official-source-and-binary-releases>`_, and Linux users may have NumPy/SciPy
available in `their repositories <https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html#third-party-vendor-package-managers>`_.

When you have NumPy, install this package at the command line using
``pip`` [1]_::

    pip install aacgmv2

The package has been tested with the following setups (others might work, too):

* Mac (64 bit), Windows (32/64 bit), and Linux (64 bit)
* Python 2.7 (except Windows), 3.6, 3.7 (except Windows 64 bit),
  and 3.8 (except Windows 64 bit)

.. [1] pip is included with Python 2 from v2.7.16 and Python 3 from v3.6. If you
       don't have pip,
       `get it here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.
