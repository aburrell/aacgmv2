Installation
============

This package requires NumPy, which you can install alone or as a part of SciPy.
`Some Python distributions <https://www.scipy.org/install.html#distributions>`_ come with NumPy/SciPy pre-installed. For Python distributions
without NumPy/SciPy, Windows/Mac users should install
`pre-compiled binaries of NumPy/SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html#official-source-and-binary-releases>`_, and Linux users may have NumPy/SciPy
available in `their repositories <https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html#third-party-vendor-package-managers>`_.

When you have NumPy, install this package at the command line using ``pip``::

    pip install aacgmv2

The package has been tested with the following setups (others might work, too):

* Mac (64 bit), Windows (32/64 bit), and Linux (64 bit)
* Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9
